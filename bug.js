This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The performance can become very slow, especially when scrolling, if the `keyExtractor` prop is not properly implemented or is missing.  Without a unique key for each item, React Native struggles to efficiently update the list, leading to dropped frames and a poor user experience.  The issue is exacerbated when dealing with frequently changing data.

```javascript
//Incorrect implementation
<FlatList
  data={myLargeDataset}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>

```
