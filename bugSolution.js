The solution involves adding a `keyExtractor` prop to the `FlatList` component. The `keyExtractor` should be a function that takes an item from the data array and returns a unique ID for that item.  This ID is used by React Native to efficiently track changes and update the list. 

```javascript
//Correct implementation
<FlatList
  data={myLargeDataset}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

Ensure that the `id` field is unique across all items in your `myLargeDataset` array. If `id` is not available, use another unique identifier such as a database primary key or a generated UUID. Using the index is generally discouraged because it can lead to problems if items are added, removed, or reordered.

If your dataset has objects with complex keys, you can adapt the `keyExtractor` to handle them: 
```javascript
keyExtractor={(item) => item.user.id + '-' + item.timestamp}
```
This would create a unique key even with nested data. Remember to choose unique values to avoid unnecessary re-renders and performance issues.
